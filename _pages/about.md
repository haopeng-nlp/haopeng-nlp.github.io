I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) of the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/).

I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), with [Noah Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/), and my Bachelors Degree from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I spent one year at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org/) as a Young Investigator, and time at Microsoft Research, Google, and DeepMind.



My current research interests focus on **large language models (LLMs)**. Specifically, I work on AI towards:
- Solving complex reasoning problems in a generalizable way; I believe that learning from experience (e.g., through *reinforcement learning*) and insights from *human cognition* are crucial towards this goal;
- Understanding and reasoning *causally* about the world;
- Positively impacting society;
- Advancing the frontier of human knowledge and contributing to *scientific discovery*, which I see as the ultimate demonstration of true generalization beyond the human knowledge they have been trained on.


Outside work, I cater to the whims of a quartet of furry overlords: [Meera](../assets/img/pets/meera.jpg), [Loki](../assets/img/pets/loki.jpg), [Sylvie](../assets/img/pets/sylvie.jpg), and [Kea](../assets/img/pets/kea.JPG).
When they release me from their service, I [cycle](../assets/img/fun/stp.jpeg) in the summer, and (backcountry) [ski](../assets/img/fun/alta.jpg) in the winter.
