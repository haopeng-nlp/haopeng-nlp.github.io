I am an Assistant Professor at the [Siebel School of Computing and Data Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu) of the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/). I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), with [Noah Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/), and my Bachelors Degree from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 


I'm broadly interested in **large language models (LLMs)**. Recently, I focus on AI towards:
- Solving complex reasoning problems in a generalizable and data-efficient way; I believe that learning from experience (e.g., through **reinforcement learning**) and insights from **human cognition** are crucial towards this goal;
- Understanding and reasoning about the world **causally**;
- Positively impacting society;
- Advancing the frontier of human knowledge and contributing to **scientific discovery**, which I see as the ultimate demonstration of true generalization beyond the human knowledge they have been trained on.


Outside work, I cater to the whims of a quartet of furry overlords: [Meera](../assets/img/pets/meera.jpg), [Loki](../assets/img/pets/loki.jpg), [Sylvie](../assets/img/pets/sylvie.jpg), and [Kea](../assets/img/pets/kea.JPG).
When they release me from their service, I [cycle](../assets/img/fun/stp.jpeg) in the summer, and (backcountry) [ski](../assets/img/fun/alta.jpg) in the winter.
