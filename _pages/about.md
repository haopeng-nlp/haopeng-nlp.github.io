I am an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">Department of Computer Science</a> of the <a href="https://illinois.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</a>.

I received my Ph.D. from the 
<a href="https://www.washington.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">University of Washington</a>,
with
<a href="https://nasmith.github.io/" style="text-decoration:none">Noah Smith</a>,
and my Bachelors Degree from 
<a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/" style="text-decoration:none">Peking University</a>.
I spent one year at the <a href="https://allenai.org/" style="text-decoration:none">Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a> as a Young Investigator, and time at Microsoft Research, Google, and DeepMind as an intern.

My research interest broadly spans **natural language processing** and **machine learning**.
My current interests primarily include making language AI more efficient and accessible, and evaluating and improving large-scale language models' reasoning capabilities, factuality, and trustworthiness.


**Prospective Students:** I am looking for graduate students.
