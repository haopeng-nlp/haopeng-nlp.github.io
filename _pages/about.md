I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) of the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/).

I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), with [Noah Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/), and my Bachelors Degree from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I spent one year at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org/) as a Young Investigator, and time at Microsoft Research, Google, and DeepMind as an intern.

My research interest broadly spans **natural language processing** and **machine learning**. My current interests primarily include making language AI more efficient and accessible, and evaluating and improving large language models' reasoning capabilities, factuality, and trustworthiness, and their applications in the scientific domain.

Outside of work, I cater to the whims of [a trio of furry overlords](../assets/img/pets/furry_friends.jpeg): [Meera](../assets/img/pets/meera.jpg), [Loki](../assets/img/pets/loki.jpg), and [Sylvie](../assets/img/pets/sylvie.jpg).
When they release me from their service, I [cycle](../assets/img/fun/stp.jpeg) in the summer, and (backcountry) [ski](../assets/img/fun/rainier_top.jpeg) in the winter.

I'm looking for students and interns that are familiar with and interested in building LLMs. If Megatron, DeepSpeed, and training LLMs with hundreds GPUs sound exciting to you, please drop me an email and include Meera+Loki+Sylvie in the title!
